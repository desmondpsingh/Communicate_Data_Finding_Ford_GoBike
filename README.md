## by Desmond Singh

### Dataset
This project contains data set from Ford GoBike is a public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area.
The users of this platform have access available to bikes 24/7 in San Francisco, East Bay & San Jose.
This dataset was provided through Udacity's platform.
In this project, I will perform an exploratory analysis on the user utilizing this platform.
This dataset containes 16 different variables such as age, gender, weekday, time and others. 

### Summary of findings

In this exploration, There are two types of users that utilize this platform, They are Subscribers and Customers.
Through the analysis i found that both users utilized the bike share system more often around summertime (March-May) dropping off drastically in Winter (Nov-Dec). I also checked to see if there were any differences in trends for genders. The Trends for both genders was the same when analyzing data, There were some minor difference but they were insignificant. 

### Key Insights for Presentation

For presentation, I focused on influence of month, weekday, hours and I also filtered data to include age groups 65 and under since 95% of users were under 57. I also used different color palletes to differentiate genders & User_type. I also used the Heatmap to show when bikes are high in demand throughout the week.
