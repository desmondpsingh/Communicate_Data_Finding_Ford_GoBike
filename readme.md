## by Desmond Singh

### Dataset
This project contains data set from Ford GoBike which is a public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area.
The users of this platform have access available to bikes 24/7 in San Francisco, East Bay & San Jose.

The Dataset consists of 16 variable like usertype, gender, age, birth year. 
In the Dataset 95% of users are under the age of 57. We removed users 65 and older to reflect the data. 


### Summary of findings

In this exploration, There are two types of Clients that utilize this platform: Subscribers and Customers.
Through the analysis I found that Subscribers rent bikes on weekdays from 7-9PM & 4-7PM. Customers on the other hand utilize the services more during the weekends from 10AM-6PM. 
When observing key differences in regards to gender for Customer and Subscribers, There was no noticeable difference besides Ratio of Men using was higher then women using the service.
### Key Insights for Presentation

For presentation, I focused on User habits in 2018 -2019. I start the analysis by first  filtering data to include age groups 65 and under since 95% of users were under 57. Then i visualize the data by splitting Subscriber and Customers.
After that I analyze habits by looking at month, weekday, hours and Gender from Jan 2018 - May 2019.  I alse used different color palletes to differentiate genders & User_type. To finish of the analysis I use the Heatmaps to show when bikes are high in demand throughout the week.
